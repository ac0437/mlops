## MLOps

- Set of practices to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production relialbly and efficiently
- DevOps of ML

### Fundamentals

Exponential growth of data
Importance of Artifical Intelligence
ML is not just about building models

- Configuration
- Data Collection
- Feature Extraction
- Data Verification
- ML Code
- Machine resource management
- Analysis tools
- Progress Management tools
- Serving infrastuctur
- Monitoring

Business problem that is being solved

- Cost of wrong prediction
  - Wasted resources, unsold products, understock, missed opportunities, mad customers
- Forecasting
  - Data gathering
  - Historical sales analysis
  - Market trend analysis
  - Actual forecasting
- ROI
  - comparing potential increase in sales and decrease in wasted resources due to improved forecast vs developing and maintaining AI/ML solutions
